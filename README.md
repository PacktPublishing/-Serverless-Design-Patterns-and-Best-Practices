## About the Video Course
This course describes reusable serverless patterns for event-driven data processing, web applications, mobile and IoT applications, application ecosystems, and event workflows. You will learn about the various patterns such as the command pattern, messaging pattern, priority queue pattern, and fan-out pattern, and gain insights into when to use which one. Patterns related to authentication, automation, data management, and error handling will also be covered. We also delve into DevOps concepts and take you through CI and CD. Finally you'll master patterns involved in testing, securing, and scaling your cloud-native applications
